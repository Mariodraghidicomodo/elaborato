Project data science

This is my final project for programming. I have analyzed three datasets containing information about the cards from the physical game Magic: The Gathering. the project is structured into various components:
- Exploring the datasets
- cleaning the datasets
- merging them into a single dataset
- creating plots
- model to predict prices
- streamlit
